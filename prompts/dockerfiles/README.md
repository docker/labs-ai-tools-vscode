# Background

These prompts add Dockerfile authoring skills to the assistant.

* the [user prompts](100_user_prompt.md) direct the assist to extract details about the project, and then write a Dockerfile to the root of the project.
* the [npm best practices](npm-best-practices.md) is are added to the system prompts whenever the assist detects that this is an NPM project.

## functions

These instructions in these prompts rely on 3 functions

1. `analyze_project` - requires read-only access to the project and extracts details from the project to give the assistant context for authoring the Dockerfile
2. `write_files` - has read-write access to the project and will write Dockerfiles so that developers don't have to copy and paste data out of a chat.
3. `docker_scout_tag_recommendation` - uses Docker Scout to improve the choice tag selection during code generation.
